## üéÆ Problem 1: Number Guessing Game
### Learning Objectives:
- Understanding basic Python syntax
- Working with variables and user input
- Using while loops and if statements
- Implementing basic game logic

### 1.1 Study the Example
```python
# Example of a simple number checker
import random

# Generate a random number between 1 and 10
secret = random.randint(1, 10)

# Get one guess from the user
guess = int(input("Guess the number (1-10): "))

if guess == secret:
    print("You got it!")
else:
    print(f"Sorry, it was {secret}")

# Run this cell to try the simple version
```

### 1.2 Your First Task
```python
# Task: Complete the number guessing game
# Requirements:
# 1. Number should be between 1 and 100
# 2. Player gets 7 attempts
# 3. Tell player if guess is too high or too low
# 4. Keep track of attempts used

import random

def number_guessing_game():
    # Your code here
    pass  # Delete this line when you start coding

# Test your game
number_guessing_game()
```

### 1.3 Challenge Extension
```python
# Challenge: Improve the game
# Add these features:
# 1. Ask if player wants to play again
# 2. Keep track of high score (least attempts)
# 3. Add difficulty levels (easy: 1-50, hard: 1-200)

# Your improved version here
```

## üå°Ô∏è Problem 2: Temperature Converter
### Learning Objectives:
- Creating functions
- Input validation
- Mathematical operations
- Error handling

### 2.1 Study the Example
```python
# Example of a simple Celsius to Fahrenheit converter
def celsius_to_fahrenheit(celsius):
    fahrenheit = (celsius * 9/5) + 32
    return round(fahrenheit, 2)

# Test the function
temp = float(input("Enter temperature in Celsius: "))
result = celsius_to_fahrenheit(temp)
print(f"{temp}¬∞C = {result}¬∞F")
```

### 2.2 Your Task
```python
# Task: Create a complete temperature converter
# Requirements:
# 1. Convert between C, F, and K
# 2. Handle invalid inputs
# 3. Round results to 2 decimal places
# 4. Include input validation

def convert_temperature(value, from_unit, to_unit):
    # Your code here
    pass

# Example test cases:
test_cases = [
    (0, 'C', 'F'),    # Should be 32.0
    (98.6, 'F', 'C'), # Should be 37.0
    (300, 'K', 'C'),  # Should be 26.85
]

# Test your function
for value, from_unit, to_unit in test_cases:
    result = convert_temperature(value, from_unit, to_unit)
    print(f"{value}¬∞{from_unit} = {result}¬∞{to_unit}")
```

### 2.3 Challenge Extension
```python
# Challenge: Create a temperature converter interface
# Add these features:
# 1. Menu for selecting conversion type
# 2. Continuous conversion until user quits
# 3. History of conversions

# Your improved version here
```

## üìä Problem 3: Word Statistics
### Learning Objectives:
- String manipulation
- Using dictionaries
- Working with loops
- Basic statistics

### 3.1 Study the Example
```python
# Example of basic text analysis
text = "Hello World"
print(f"Length: {len(text)}")
print(f"Words: {len(text.split())}")
print(f"Uppercase: {text.upper()}")
```

### 3.2 Your Task
```python
# Task: Create a text analysis function
# Requirements:
# 1. Count total words
# 2. Calculate average word length
# 3. Find most common letter
# 4. Count vowels and consonants

def analyze_text(text):
    # Your code here
    pass

# Test your function
sample_text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog!"
results = analyze_text(sample_text)
# Add code to print results
```

### 3.3 Challenge Extension
```python
# Challenge: Enhance the text analyzer
# Add these features:
# 1. Identify palindromes
# 2. Count punctuation marks
# 3. Find longest and shortest words

# Your improved version here
```

## üõí Problem 4: Shopping List Manager

    shopping_list.append(item)
    print(f"Added: {item}")

def show_list():
    for item in shopping_list:
        print(f"- {item}")

    if answer.lower() == correct_answer.lower():
        print("Correct!")
        return 1
    else:
        print(f"Sorry, the answer was {correct_answer}")
